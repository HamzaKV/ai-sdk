Add `@varlabs/ai/utils/json-schema` (`JsonSchemaParameters`, `InferJsonSchemaParameters`, etc.) - the JSON-Schema-shaped tool-parameter type and its type-level inference, extracted from two byte-identical copies in `provider.anthropic` and `provider.openai`. Both providers now import it instead of redefining it; their own `CustomTool`/`CustomToolBase`/`customTool` stay provider-specific by design (each provider's tool wire shape is deliberately bespoke, not derived from a shared type - see the ai-sdk gap-scan notes). No consumer-visible type change in either provider.
